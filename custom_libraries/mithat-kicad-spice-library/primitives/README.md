SPICE Primitives library for KiCad
==================================

The symbols in this library correspond to the primitive components that are 
built into SPICE.

I consider this library a derivative of the PSPICE library that ships in the
standard KiCad distribution. I have therefore specified KiCad's original author
(as identified in the files accompanying the Debian package) as the copyright 
holder--and have included myself to cover the bits I have added.

This library, like the parent KiCad distribution, is licensed under the GPLv2.
